Form Handling
Form handling is a critical aspect of the AwaCare Medical Center website, particularly for the appointment booking process. The processorder.php script plays a pivotal role in this area.
Data Submission: When a user submits the appointment booking form, the information is sent to the processorder.php script. This script handles the incoming data securely, ensuring that it is processed efficiently and stored appropriately.
Data Validation: To maintain the integrity of the information received, both client-side and server-side validation measures are implemented. Client-side validation prompts users to fill out required fields before submission, while server-side validation in the PHP script checks the data for completeness and correctness after it has been submitted.
Security Measures: The script uses functions like htmlspecialchars() to prevent security vulnerabilities, protecting against potential threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures that patient data is handled safely and securely.
User Feedback: After the form is processed, the script sends confirmation messages to users, providing immediate feedback on their appointment booking. This enhances the user experience by keeping patients informed and engaged with the booking process.

Front-End Development (HTML, CSS)
The AwaCare Medical Center website uses semantic HTML and CSS for a user-friendly interface. The styles.css file ensures consistent styling, and media queries enhance responsiveness across devices.
Back-End Development (PHP, Security)
PHP handles form submissions securely through the processorder.php script, utilizing functions like htmlspecialchars() to protect against vulnerabilities. Confirmation messages are sent after successful appointment requests to enhance user trust.
